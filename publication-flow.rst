Publication Flow
================

Documents (and their associated files) are all publishable documents (except Data Access Requests). Being a publishable document means that there can be different revisions of the document before being published.

The publication flow refers to the work flow from a draft document to its publication. The following diagram represent the life cycle of a document with its Revision Status and Transitions:

Revision Status
---------------

The publishable document goes through several states allowing to separate user privileges: some users will be responsible for the content edition only, while other users will be responsible for the reviewing and the publication of the document.

A draft document can be changed/edited as many times as necessary. When the edition work is done, the document is staged for being reviewed. The state of the document that is reviewed is the one that will be published. Once the review and the publication is done, the document is ready again for edition. When a document is to be removed, it is first marked as being deleted (without affecting the publication) before being permanently removed.

The revision status is an enumeration of named states:

+------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------+-----------------------------+-----------------------------+----------------+----------------+
| Status           | Description                                                          | Editable                    | Publishable                 | Deletable                   | From Status    | To Status      |
